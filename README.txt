1. Created a simple CreditCardProvider solution using ASP.Net core 7 MVC
2. Copied .sln and .bak file for database
3. We can run the web app and click on the dropdown menu above to add the CreditCard transactions and to view the client statement
4. Also written the Test cases (but having issue in passing the DBContext to the methos to test. Trying the Mock DB but not successful and running out of time) 

Tried to write the simple code and tried to keep the controller light.

Missed by time limit:
1. Validations are not implemented
2. Test case written but not complete.
